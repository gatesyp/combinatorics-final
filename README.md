# combinatorics-final
Final project for Graph Theory and Combinatorics  
Visualization of Djisktra algorithm
## Resources
npm init
npm install vis

## Note
10, 20, 30, 40 seems to generate a good graph

## TODO
- implement Djisktra using JS
- update Distance Table dynamically, for each iteration
- add button to show next iteration
- add button to perform algorithm all at once?
- change colors of edges/nodes while traversing
